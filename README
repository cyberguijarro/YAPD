YAPD: Yet Another Perforce Diff
http://github.com/cyberguijarro/YAPD/tree/master

YAPD is a simple Python script that converts "p4 diff" command output to
regular "unified diffs" or "patches", than can be later shared and applied
in different workspaces with tools like "patch".

INSTALLATION

On UNIX-like operating systems, just copy "yapd.py" to any of the folders
in your PATH environment and rename it as you like ("yapd" is my choice).

On Windows, copy "yapd.bat" and "yapd.py" to any of the folders in your
PATH environment and correct "yapd.bat" with the right path to "yapd.py".

USAGE

Invoking "yapd" with no parameters generates a diff for all "opened for 
(edit|add|delete)" files, but changelist id's are accepted as well:

$ yapd          # Diff for all changelists
$ yapd default  # Diff for the default changelist
$ yapd 3 4 28   # Diff for changelists 3, 4 and 28
